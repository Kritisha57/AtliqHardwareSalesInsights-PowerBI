# AtliqHardwareSalesInsights-PowerBI
Codebasics verified PowerBI project on Atliq Hardware sales during COVID-19.
As a Power BI developer, I worked on a project for Atliq Hardware where I designed interactive dashboards for the financial, sales, supply chain, and marketing views using DAX and Power Query Editor, as well as various visualization tools in Power BI.

The first step of the project involved gathering the necessary data from various sources and cleaning it using the Power Query Editor. This involved tasks such as merging tables, removing duplicates, and filtering out irrelevant data.

Once the data was cleaned and prepared, I began designing the dashboards using the various visualization tools available in Power BI. For the financial view, I created visuals such as bar charts and tables to display revenue, expenses, and profit over time. I also designed a KPI dashboard to display key financial metrics such as gross margin and net income.

For the sales view, I designed visuals to show sales performance by product, region, and sales representative. This included creating scatter plots, heat maps, and pie charts to show sales trends and identify top-selling products and regions.

In the supply chain view, I designed visuals to show inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, and supplier performance. This included creating line charts and gauges to display inventory levels and bar charts to show order fulfillment rates and supplier performance metrics.

For the marketing view, I designed visuals to show campaign performance, customer behavior, and lead generation. This included creating funnel charts to show the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and line charts to show customer behavior trends over time.

Throughout the project, I used DAX functions to create calculated fields and measures to perform various calculations, such as revenue per unit, profit margin, and year-over-year growth.

Overall, the project resulted in a set of interactive dashboards that allowed Atliq Hardware to gain insights into their financial, sales, supply chain, and marketing performance, and make data-driven decisions to improve their business operations.
